Installation
============

.. important::

   This is extension will only run with PHP5.5 or higher.

The extension can be installed like any other extension for TYPO3:

Get it from the Extension Manager
---------------------------------

Search for the extension key *dm_developerlog* and import and install the extension from the repository.

Get it from typo3.org
---------------------

You can always get the current version from `http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/dm_developerlog/current/
<http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/dm_developerlog/current/>`_ by downloading either the t3x or zip version.

Upload and install the file via the Extension Manager.

Get it via Composer
-------------------

Require the package ``diemedialen/dm-developerlog``.

.. important::

   This extension has never been tested with TYPO3 6.2 and composer. Good luck!

Get it from github
------------------

If you want to take the risk of using the latest bleeding edge version, you know your way around ;-)
